**Issue Summary:**

On June 5, 2024, from 14:30 to 17:00 UTC, our web application experienced a significant outage lasting 2 hours and 30 minutes. The outage caused the main service to be completely inaccessible to users, resulting in a 100% service disruption. Users were unable to access their accounts or use any functionality of the web application. The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings during a routine update.

**Timeline:**

- **14:30 UTC** - Issue detected by automated monitoring alert indicating a sudden drop in HTTP requests.
- **14:32 UTC** - Engineering team received the alert and began initial investigation.
- **14:35 UTC** - Checked web server logs; noticed an unusual spike in 502 Bad Gateway errors.
- **14:40 UTC** - Assumed the issue was with the application servers and restarted them.
- **15:00 UTC** - Restart did not resolve the issue; escalated to the Network Operations team.
- **15:15 UTC** - Network Operations team checked network configurations and confirmed no issues.
- **15:30 UTC** - Misleading path: suspected database server overload, checked database logs and performance.
- **16:00 UTC** - Identified no anomalies in database performance, ruled out as a cause.
- **16:10 UTC** - Escalated to DevOps team to investigate load balancer settings.
- **16:25 UTC** - DevOps team discovered recent load balancer configuration change.
- **16:30 UTC** - Found misconfiguration in load balancer that caused all traffic to be routed incorrectly.
- **16:45 UTC** - Corrected the load balancer settings and began verifying system functionality.
- **17:00 UTC** - Full service restored and verified. Incident closed.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

The root cause of the outage was a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings during a routine update. Specifically, a syntax error in the configuration file caused the load balancer to route all incoming traffic to a non-existent server group, resulting in 502 Bad Gateway errors.

To resolve the issue, the DevOps team reviewed the load balancer configuration changes made during the update and identified the syntax error. They corrected the configuration file and redeployed the correct settings. Once the correct configuration was applied, the web application services were immediately restored.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

To prevent similar incidents in the future, we have identified several improvements and tasks:

- **Improvements/Fixes:**

  - Implement a configuration validation step in the deployment pipeline to catch syntax errors before they are applied.
  - Enhance monitoring alerts to include specific error codes to quickly identify routing issues.
  - Provide additional training for engineers on load balancer configuration best practices.

- **Tasks:**
  - **Implement automated configuration validation**: Add a validation script to the deployment pipeline to check for syntax errors in configuration files before deployment.
  - **Enhance monitoring systems**: Update monitoring tools to send alerts that include detailed error code information to help quickly diagnose routing problems.
  - **Update documentation and training materials**: Develop and distribute comprehensive documentation on load balancer configuration, including common pitfalls and troubleshooting steps.
  - **Regular configuration audits**: Schedule periodic audits of load balancer configurations to ensure they adhere to best practices and are free of errors.
